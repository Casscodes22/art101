	<h1> Lab:4 Pseudocoding and Problem solving </h1>
	<h3> Challenges </h3>
	<p>Some challenges I faced during this assignment were, weather my pseudocode was to vague or to descriptive. After seeing the purpose it has in the form of the comments I see how it will be benifitial moving forward into java script.</p>

	<h3> Problems </h3>
	<p> I didnt face any major problems during this assignment, and found it quite managable. I was unclear about how descriptive to be with the summery for the js header. As well as what link we should be putting in the header as well.

	//Pick one player to be the board creator
	  //Board creator choses a secret word
	    //Draw a space for every letter in the secret word
	      //The other player guesses one letter at a time from the english alphabet
	        //If the letter is guessed correctly the board creator fills the correlating space of the secret word
	          //If a letter is guessed that is not in the secret word the board creator draws a part of the hangman
	            //First wrong guess, draw an upside down “L”
	              //Second wrong guess, draw a horizontal line and the bottom of the upside down “L”

	                          //Eighth wrong guess, draw another diagonal for the left leg
	          // If the hangman stick figure has been drawn before the secret word has been guessed the player loses
