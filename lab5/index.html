	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> I faced challenges with the console, it was frustrating working in a program where if you make one mistake as simple as a symblom in the wrong place, you cant go back to fix it. I probably cleared my console around ten times in order to correctly put in my varibles correctly.</p>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> I faced problems with linking the java script output into the html but after playing around with the link I was able to fix the formatting error I had made earlier. </p>

	<h3> Results</h3>
<p> This is Lab 5 results page you are currently looking at as well as our java script outputs below. </p>

	<h4>Script Output</h4>
