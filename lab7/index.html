	<h1> Lab 7: Functions</h1>

	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> I had some minor spelling and formating erros with the window prompt link, but was able to fix the errors and get it working fairly quickly.  </p>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p>  I faced some issues with appyling my prior css styleing sheet to this lab from my previous pages. I tried to make a new one for it, and still faced issues despite being told by the TA that I had it linked properly. I was able to fix it by renaming my lab file. </p>

	<h3> Results</h3>
	<p> You have entered my window prompt to scrammble your name and resort it below. </p>

	<h3>Script Output</h3>
