	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> We had to debugg this site, but as we were navigating the errors we came to the reilization that we judt did the assignment entierly wrong. This lab was a tough week for me personally so this content was the most difficult for me to wrap my head around. Im glad we ended up working with the TA to guide us to the right direction, and catch anything we missed. </p>
<br>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> We were origginally using the document.write with functions that were not corrdinating, but We fixed this creating entierly new functions corrdinating with get element by ID's instead.  </p>
