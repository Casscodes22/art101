	<h1> Challenges </h1>
	<p> I struggled with understanding the difference between the art/101 file vs the lab/3 folder file structures and how they were supposed to cordinate with our partners work. After pushing through the confusion it became more clear half way through the assignment and I then backtracked to correct my confused efforts. </p>
	<h2> Results</h2>
	<p> This is the lab3 index.html file I have created for you, as well as a screen shots of the file structure.</p>
