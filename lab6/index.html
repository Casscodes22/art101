	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> I faced challenges with the console, the arrays and objects were confusing and somthing I need to practice more. I also faced a difficultly with printing "My Ride" from the java script file.  </p>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> I faced problems with the arrays and objects in the console and in the js. file as well as linking it properly with the html and css files.  </p>

	<h3> Results</h3>
	<p> This is my best efforts for Lab 6, this was probably the most frustrating lab thus far, but like the prior assignments, this may become easier in the future with more practice. Just how html and css have become easier and more fun and fimilir. </p>
