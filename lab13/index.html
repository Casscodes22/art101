			<h1> Lab 13: Loops </h1>

	     <h3> Challenges </h3>
		     <p> As far as the concept goes, it makes sense, however getting the results of the code to print to the webpage was difficult to figure out.  </p>
<br>

	     <h3> Problems</h3>
	      <p> We made the function, the loop, and a button to print the results, but we got stumped on how to get it to work where when you click on the button it prints the reults.  </p>
<br>

          <h3> Results</h3>
        <p> Click the button below to see which multiples are fizz, buzz, and boom! and which ones are all three! </p>
