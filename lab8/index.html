	<h1> Lab 8: Anon Funcions and Callbacks </h1>

	<h3> Challenges </h3>
		  <p>The biggest challenge I faced was my own poor grammer, and poor attention to detail charter flaw. I was able to catch some minior errors in the console and fix them in the javascript but I also needed the help of my partner and TA to catch other small details in order to get it working properly. </p>

	<h3> Problems</h3>
	     <p>I didnt face to many problems on this assignment, and the problems I did encounter were issus with spelling, or not defining a variables correctly. They were fairly stright forward and obvious problem to face and were able to corretly efficently. </p>

	<h3> Results</h3>
	     <p> Check out the console to see the output!  </p>
