<h3> Challenges </h3>
		<p> We struggled with this lab becuase it was kinda of difficult to decode the instuctions. Now that there are no examples provided we couldnt tell if we were on the right track, or where we've gone wrong previously. The TA was incredibly helpful to make sure our questions were answered </p>

<h3> Problems</h3>
	<p> We faced some problems with correctly linking the class verses id, but was able to correct it and get it working properly. Another problem we had to fix, was coreectly writing our javascript with jQuery it felt like learning a new programming language. So making sure our puncuaion and symbols were all correct was something we faced. </p>
