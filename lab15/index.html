			<h1> Lab 15: AJax </h1>

      	<h3> Challenges </h3>
      		<p> This assignment was difficult because I still don't feel very confident with jQuery, let alone debugging and looking for errors within it. We did refer heavily to the example we did in class, and still faced challenges with getting the images to come through in the output. </p>
      <br>

      	<h3> Problems</h3>
      	<p>We got the api working and gave out the text response through the button function, but eventually we worked out the syntax isse and were able to get the image working.  </p>
      <br>

        <h3> Results</h3>
        <p> This webpage, button and api response is our results.  </p>

        <h3>Output: </h3>
