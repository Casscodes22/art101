		<p> I am a third year transfer art student, and this is my first experience with computer programing. I am a tactile artist and mostly work with clay and sculptureal materials such as wood, metal, and mixed media. in order to have compleate control of how I publish my work online, learning to code is an important skill. Having an online presence is nessesary for artist to be discovered, and to promate your work, so gaining a strong understanding on the back end of how computers oporate is curtial.  </p>
